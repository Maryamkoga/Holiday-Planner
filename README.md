# Holiday-Planner
Planner to calculate how much a user spends on holiday
- This program creates variables to store details such as the number of nights to be spent at the hotel, city the user is travelling to and the number of days the user will be hiring a car
- Functions are created to calculate the hotel cost, plane cost and car rental cost and all of these are summed up to calculate the total holiday cost
- Then the user is given a breakdown of all of the costs plus the total cost for the holiday
